# CNN-practice

This project was made in Binghamton's Research Immersion program. The focus of this project is to use tensorflow and teach how a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to predict based off pattern and visual analysis. 

The download size for the file that goes alongside the source code is very large, and not accepted by GitHub.
